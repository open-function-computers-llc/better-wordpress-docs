### Usage

Firstly, create a new template file in the `tpl/` folder. For this example we'll name the file `home-title.tpl`. For a complete guide on how to use Handlebars templating syntax, check out [the handlebars-php repository](https://github.com/salesforce/handlebars-php). 

```
<!-- tpl/home-title.tpl -->

Welcome to <span style="color:red">{{title}}</span>!
```

#### Rendering

To render this we need to call the file and supply it with the data it needs. Since I only want to use this template on my home page, I'll add this code to `home.php`:

```
<?php #home.php

echo site()->render("home-title",[
    "title" => get_bloginfo("name")
]);
```

Recall we added a function in `functions.php` to expose our `Site` object to all the pages, and that's what we're using here.

Here's what we see on the homepage now:

{{< figure src="/images/handlebars-example.png" >}}

Wow! What a site!

### Template File Extension

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Note that when you change the template extension, the parent folder name must match it." />}}

By default Handlebars templates exist in `.tpl` files within the `tpl/` folder in the theme root. This can be changed by adding editing a field in `config.php`:

```
return [
    ... # Other options
    "handlebars" => [
        "template-extension" => ".tpl"
    ]
]
```
