## Install

In the root of your theme, run the following command to install `laravel-mix`.

```bash
npm i laravel-mix
```

## Configure

Next, still in the root of your theme, create a new file called `webpack.mix.js` and add the code below:

```js
// webpack.mix.js

let mix = require('laravel-mix');

mix.js('src/app.js', 'dist').setPublicPath('dist').version();
```

This will tell laravel-mix to compile `src/app.js` and output it in the `dist` folder. The addition of `.version()` will generate a random hash to append to the filename, forcing browsers to update their cache. To add other types of files, check out [these examples](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/6.0/examples).

## Compile

To compile once:

```bash
npx mix
```

To watch for changes:
```bash
npx mix watch
```

## Including Scripts/Styles

better-wordpress will automatically look for Laravel Mix's `mix-manifest.json` in the `dist` folder and register/enqueue any javascript or css it finds there.

The only requirement on your end is to include the `wp_head()` function in your theme's `<head>` element. For example:

```html
<!doctype html> <!-- header.php -->
<html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>

<head>
  ...
  <?php wp_head(); ?>
  ...
</head>

<body <?php body_class(); ?>>
```
