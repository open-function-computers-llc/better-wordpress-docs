### Requirements

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="This package uses Composer for dependancy management. If you don't already have Composer installed, follow <a href='https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md'>this guide</a> for your system. If you're planning on using better-wordpress in multiple projects it's recommended you install Composer globally, otherwise locally works fine too." />}}

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- PHP ``>= 7.4``
- WordPress ``>= 5.7`` (older versions may not be supported in the future)


### Installing

Navigate to your theme's folder within the WordPress file structure (by default `wp-content/themes/<theme>`) and run the following command to install `open-function-computers-llc/better-wordpress` and its dependancies to your project.

```bash
# Composer Globally Installed
composer require open-function-computers-llc/better-wordpress

# Composer Locally Installed
php composer.phar require open-function-computers-llc/better-wordpress
```


### Add Configuration File

Once you've installed the package, navigate to `vendor/open-function-computers-llc/better-wordpress` and copy `config.example.php` to the root of your theme folder. Rename this file simply to `config.php`.

Here's what your theme folder should look like now:
```
style.css # Required by WordPress
index.php # Required by WordPress
screenshot.png # Required by WordPress
config.php # Renamed example better-wordpress config
composer.json # Generated by Composer
vendor/ # Generated by Composer
| open-function-computers/
| | better-wordpress/
| | | config.example.php # Original example better-wordpress config
| | | ... # Other package files
| ... # Other packages
... # Other theme files
```
