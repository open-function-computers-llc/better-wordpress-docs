Calling the `site()` function in any of your theme's php files will return the Site object, a collection of convenient methods to interface with various parts of WordPress.

To ensure you can use the function, make sure you followed the instructions on the [initializing](../../getting-started/initializing) page. It's literally one step, you can't mess it up.
