The future of __better-wordpress__

---

Like any piece of software, better-wordpress is constantly evolving to fit the needs of our team. Here are some of our current plans regarding the future of the project:

#### Near Future:

- Caching, optimizing page load times.
- PostCSS integration
  - With this would come support for Tailwind CSS
- WordPress Rest API Integration
  - Routing options

#### Farther Down the Line:

- Admin control pages
- Deprecating ACF in favor of the WP block editor
